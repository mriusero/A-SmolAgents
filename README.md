## Overview
This project was created as part of the [Agents Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course) by Hugging Face. 

The purpose of this agent is to demonstrate how to build and deploy an AI agent with [SmolAgents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/index), a lightweight framework from Hugging Face for creating AI agents that can interact with external tools and APIs effectively.

## Design
The agent is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new tools and functionalities.
As a learning project, it uses the SmolAgents framework to handle the agentic workflow, which simplifies the decision-making process and tool interactions through code generation from an Instruct Model.

## Usage
The agent has been implemented in a Gradio app made for demonstrate some specific tasks answering.
You can interact with the agent on the [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mriusero/a-smolagents) and see demonstration uses-cases.
